## Overview  
This project analyzes **customer churn** at Databel, focusing on uncovering the **key drivers** behind customer departures.  
By understanding churn patterns across **states, demographics, and service usage**, this analysis enables stakeholders to design **targeted strategies** that reduce churn-related losses and improve long-term retention.

## Problem Statement  
Databel is facing a **high customer attrition rate**, which poses a serious risk to revenue, market share, and growth.  
Churn appears to be influenced by multiple factors including **demographics, contract types, data consumption**, and **competitive pressure**.  
A detailed investigation is required to identify the **underlying causes** and develop effective, data-backed retention strategies.

- Which **age group** has the highest churn rate relative to its size?
